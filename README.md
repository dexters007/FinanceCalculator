# Finance Calculator

This project is a simple Financial calculator to calculate a investment of a certain amout or a payback on a home loan.

The code given will calculate your return on investment on a simple or compound interest over a certain period at a 
given rate and print out the return of that period.

With the home load once you have entered the required Value, interest rate and number of years it will print out the monthly repayment.

The project can run in your terminal by downloading the contents of this file, cd to the folder and run
python3 finance_calulators.py

As time goes it will be developed with either Django or Flask and a user interface will be created.
